    <p>Hi! My name is <strong><u>Akenyae Jones</strong></u> and I’m passionate about cybersecurity. My love for technology started at a young age—I was absolutely obsessed with customizing my <em>MySpace</em> page. That early curiosity sparked a lifelong interest in how technology works and how to protect digital information. Now, I'm pursuing a degree in cybersecurity and looking forward to building a future in the tech field.</p>

    <p>When I’m not studying or learning about new tech trends, I enjoy spending my spare time cooking new recipes and reading. Whether it's a mystery novel or an inspiring autobiography, reading helps me relax and stay curious. I also love trying new dishes and experimenting with flavors in the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Here are a few things I enjoy:</p> <li> Learning about ethical hacking and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity</li> <li> Cooking homemade meals and learning new recipes </li> <li>Reading psychological thriller novels and exploring different places I've never been to before.</li>
