        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707–1783)</h1>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.</p>
        
        Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
        
        <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler’s work, <em>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</em> (1748), remained a standard textbook in the field for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, he wrote <cite>Lettres à une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768–1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>
        
        <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

    <aside>
        <h2>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h2>
        <p>Euler's Equation:</p>
        <p><code>cos(x) + i·sin(x) = e<sup>ix</sup></code> demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry.</p>
        <p>From this equation, it's easy to derive the identity <code>e<sup>&pi;i</sup> + 1 = 0</code>, which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
        <p>A poll of readers conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named Euler’s Identity as the most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>

          <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
          <p>
               <img src="scytale.gif" alt="Scytale Device" class="float-left" width="250" height="69"/>
            <strong class="keyword">Cryptography</strong> is the science
            of secure communications, formed from the Greek words
            <em>krypt&#243;s</em> meaning "hidden" and <i>l&#243;gos</i>,
            meaning "word." The first recorded use of cryptography
            was by the Spartans who as early as 400 BC employed a cipher
            device called a <strong class="keyword">scytale</strong> to
            send secret communications between military
            commanders. The scytale consisted of a tapered baton around which
            was wrapped a piece of parchment inscribed with the message. Once
            unwrapped the parchment appeared to contain an incomprehensible
            set of letters; however when wrapped around another baton of
            identical size the original text appears.
          </p>

          <p>Cryptographers developed more and more ingenious systems,
            but it was in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century that the science
            of cryptography took off. The first major achievement was the
            development of rotor cipher machines. An American, Edward Hebern
            recognized that by hardwiring alphabetic substitution in
            the connections from one side of an electrical rotor to those
            on the other side and cascading a collection of such rotors,
            alphabetic substitutions of almost any complexity could be
            produced. German engineers independently discovered the rotor
            concept and designed the precursors to the most famous cipher
            machine in history &ndash; the German
            <strong class="keyword">Enigma Machine</strong> which was
            used during World War II. The cracking
            of the Enigma ciphers by British and Polish cryptanalysts is
            one of the greatest triumphs in the history of cryptography
            and played an important role in the Allied victory.

        The Almighty has his own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense 
        cometh." If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, 
        in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through his 
        appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he gives to both North and South 
        this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern 
        therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living 
        God always ascribe to him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Fondly do we hope &mdash; fervently do we pray &mdash; that this 
        mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue 
        until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited 
        toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by 
        another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must 
        be said, "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."
      </p>
      <p>
        With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God 
        gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up 
        the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his 
        widow, and his orphan &mdash; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace 
        among ourselves, and with all nations.
